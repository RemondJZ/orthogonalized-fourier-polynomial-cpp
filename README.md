# Orthogonalized Forier Polynomials for Signal Approximation and Transfer
This repository contains the code implementing the paper *Orthogonalized Forier Polynomials for Signal Approximation and Transfer*, authored by Filippo Maggioli, Simone Melzi, Michael Bronstein, Maks Ovsjanikov and Emanuele Rodol√†.  

The paper is available at ... (available soon)  

## Requirements
You need a working installation of *MATLAB*. The code has been developed and tested with *MATLAB 2019b*, so there is no guarantee it works on other distribution.  

If you have troubles with the code, please contact us.

## Running the code
The repository contains a package `figgen`, where all the demos are. If you want to run an experiment, simply type on the *MATLAB* shell `figgen.<script_name>`. As an alternative, in the *MATLAB* file explorer you can click the `+` next to the `figgen` folder, open any script and running it with the run button.
